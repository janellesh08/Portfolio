								<h2>History</h2>
								<p>The story of the small town girl is one that I'm sure you've heard many times so one more time can't hurt. I was born and raised in Montgomery, AL.
									I started working in customer service roles at 18 and since then I worked my way up to dining room manager of a top Atlanta country club. I found that I 
									was ready for a more exciting, stable, and secure career so I decided to make the switch to web development in 2019. I started by teaching myself using 
									any and all free online resources and then jumped into different cohorts and courses to expand on my knowlege. Finally, I found my way to DigitalCrafts
									Web Development Bootcamp and fully committed to the process of becoming a proficient, confident, and passionate computer programmer. I am excited everyday 
									to see what knew technology I can learn and what creative techniques I can develop.
								</p>
								<p>I attended Auburn University at Montgomery and Troy University but it took me a while to discover what I was really interested in making my career. I had 
									many different jobs over the years ranging from server to kid's club attendant at Gold's Gym. I even joined the Air Force in an attempt to find my forever
									 thing. I realized pretty quickly that none of that was for me but I continued to do it until I decided that I wanted something new. All of my experiences
									  over the years have shaped me into who I am today and I am grateful for each one but I have never been more ready to break into this new chapter. 
								</p>
								<h2>Today</h2>
								<p>I love finding projects to work on and improve my skill, however I have a wide variety of interests. I love music, movies, and art in all forms. I rollerskate, paint, 
									make Youtube videos, make natural hair care products and coach cheerleading! If you LOVE  my Yzma costume (featured above) I have tons more since Halloween is the most wonderful time of year. 
									My life is organized chaos but always an adventure and I can't wait to see where I go from here. I have a lot of ideas that I can't wait
									for the world to see!
